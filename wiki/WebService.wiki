#summary RESTful web service for svm4j.

= Introduction =

A subset of svm4j's functionality is exposed as a RESTful web service. Training sets can be submitted, models obtained and points classified, using appropriate HTTP actions.

The REST functionality is implemented using the [http://www.restlet.org/ Restlet] framework and hosted on Google App Engine at the following root url:

       [http://tommerw.appspot.com/] 

= Details =

The svm4j web service exposes a REST interface allowing for basic training and classification operations.  Resources are represented as XML and exchanged with the server through HTTP GET and POST requests.  Following are instructions and examples for performing the various operations. 

==Posting a Training Set==

You can invoke the SVM engine by posting a training set to the service.  This results in the creation of a model which best classifies the training points.

To post the training set submit a POST request to the following URI:

       [http://tommerw.appspot.com/trainingset].

For example we can create a simple training set like so:


And save it as *training-set.xml*.

We can then post the training request with the following cUrl command:

      {{{curl -X POST --data @training-set.xml --header "Content-Type:text/xml" http://tommerw.appspot.com/trainingset}}}

The http response will look something like this:
